						<p style="color:white">Jadon Sancho has been unstoppable in recent weeks, chalking up three goals and another three assists in the Bundesliga for Borussia Dortmund in February. With a direct hand in six goals, he was the most prolific source of goals in the Bundesliga last month alongside Christopher Nkunku and Serge Gnabry. He also set up teammates 13 times, which was the most of any BVB player. However, February was just the tip of the iceberg for Sancho this season.</p>

							<p style="color:white">He came, he saw, and he scored like few before him. Erling Haaland has certainly made a lasting first impression in the Bundesliga. The 19-year-old Norwegian has quickly justified what some may have seen as premature praise following his move from Red Bull Salzburg to Borussia Dortmund. He came off the bench for his debut against FC Augsburg and scored a hat-trick to help BVB turn things around for a 5-3 win. His second appearance a week later also came as a substitute at home to 1. FC Köln, this time bagging himself a brace. “It’s a real shame he’s slacking. Three goals, then two – I hope it’s not one next time,” goalkeeper Roman Bürki joked after the 5-1 win over the Billy Goats</p>

							<p style="color:white">Erling Haaland's record-breaking start to life with Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga has sent shockwaves across the footballing world. The Norwegian striker could never have imagined a better beginning with BVB, with the players around him making his goal-scoring job so much easier.</p>
